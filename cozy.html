        <div class="content2"> The two sisters Alicia and Sofia green grew up together on a small 
            farm nearby Uppsala Sweden and has childhood been interested in 
            making things by hand. It could be everything from clay vases to 
            their own clothes and more. but the things they liked to do the most 
            have always been to bake pastries and make their own candles. The 
            two sisters already have a well-known bakery that they have owned 
            since 2010 with the most wonderful smell of newly baked sweets. 
            With the inspiration of the newly baked cinnamon rolls, they began 
            to make candles with the same smell and started to sell them in the 
            bakery at the darker end of 2020. the sales went wonderful and the 
            customers were amazed by the smell. The candle family has since 
            then grown and they now also have the scent of “Hallongråtta” and 
            “Chokladboll” and has the thoughts of continuing on the Swedish 
            Fika theme and ad more smells to the candle family. The candles 
            have been a popular addition to the bakery so the sisters decided 
            to start a company with it, so that everyone can take a part of the 
            scent. since 2022 anyone can get a hand on a candle by going to the 
            sister's website cozy.com. The candles with the scent of newly baked 
            always make the home cozy, or is it cozy that makes the home?
